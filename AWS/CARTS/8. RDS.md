- RDS stands for `Relational Database Service`, which basically offers a way to setup, operate and scale your relational databases in the cloud
- Relational Databases include [MariaDB, MySQL, Amazon Aurora, SQL Server, PostgreSQL]
- RDS Supports `Password Authentication`,  `Password + IAM-based Authentication`, `Password + Kerberos-based Authentication`
- RDS has to types to Access Controls. `IAM level Access`, and `Network Level Access`
- In `Network Level Access`, you put the RDS instance in a private VPC and you can control whet IPs are allowed to access that Instance
- RDS Proxy:
	- Handles traffic between the Client App and the Database
	- It helps you enforce IAM authentication for the Database and Securely sotre creds in AWS `Secrets Manager`

### Enumeration

| **Description** | **Command** |
|--- | --- |
| Describe RDS Clusters | `aws rds describe-db-clusters` |
| Describe Database instances in RDS | `aws rds describe-db-instances` |
| Get the Subnet Groups in RDS | `aws rds describe-db-subnet-groups` |
| Get info about the database security groups in RDS | `aws rds describe-db-security-groups` |
| Get info about the RDS proxies | `aws rds describe-db-proxies` |


**`Note`** If you are targeting an RDS instance located in a private VPC, you need to first compromise a component (Lambda Function / EC2 Instance) which is running in the same private VPC as the victim RDS instance

**`Note`** For IAM-based Authentication, your object needs to have the policy to allow it the `rds-db:connect` Action on the desired resource, then you can use the below command to generate a token to be used to access the database

`aws rds generate-db-auth-token --hostname ${Hostname} --port ${Port} --username ${Username} --region ${Region}`
`mysql -h ${Host} -u ${Username} --enable-cleartext-plugin --password=${Token}`

**`Note`** If you are running a mariadb client on your host, you done have to specify the `--enable-cleartext-plugin` in yout mysql command
