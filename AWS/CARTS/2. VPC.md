VPC stand for Virtual Private Cloud --> Help you logically setup/provision your own isolated infrastructure on AWS cloud on a `Virtual Network` you define
	- You have complete control over your infra, including the `IP address reange`, `subnets`, `routing tables` and `network gatwayes`

#### VPC Components
- Subnets
- Routing Tables
- Internet Gateways
- NAT Gateway
- Network ACLs, and more...

### VPC Routing table types 

![[Routing Table Types.png]]

- **VPC Peering**           --> Allows communication between two VPCs
	- VPC Peering is not transitive --> if `VPC1 can access VPC2` & `VPC2 can access VPC3` that doesn't mean that `VPC1 can access VPN3`
- **VPC Endpoint**         --> If you are on a private subnet and want to access other AWS services thats only accessible through internet, you use `VPC Endpoint`.
	- VPC Endpoint services powered by private link without requiring an `IGW`, NAT device or even a VPN connection.
	- Traffic between your VPN and AWS services doesn't leave Amazon's network

- **VPN Gateway**         -->  Used if you want to expand your Cloud infra to on-prem or vice versa
- **Network Interface**  --> Just a regular network interface that can be attached to your `EC2` instance and configure its own routing table for it

Routing tables can be attached to a single subnet or multiple subnets

- **Internet Gateway (IGW):** enable communication between recources in the VPC and the internet
- **NAT Gateway:** Allow instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet/other AWS services while prevent a connection originating from the internet to these instances 
- **Network ACLs**: optional layer of security enforced on a subnet level (a basic firewall to control inbount & outbound traffic)
	- an ACL can be applied to multiple subnets but a subnet can have only one active ACL at a time

**Note: every reagion has only 1 VPC by default so other VPCs are customly created by the customer**
### #Lab_Deployment_Issue
Make sure you are using a correct AMI ID corresponding to your region & change the AMI ID in `variable.tf` file 
```json
