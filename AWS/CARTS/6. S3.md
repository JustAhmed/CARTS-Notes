- S3, stands for **S**imple **S**torage **S**ervice, is a storage service that allows users to store and retrieve at any time and from anywhere on the web.
- It supports all types of file formats. The stored files are called `objects` and all objects are stored inside a `Bucket`
- Users & other AWS services can perform the following operations on S3: `List`, `Get`, `Put`, `Delete` 
- `S3` Has 2 types of policies:
	- `Resource-based Policies` are attached to the object/bucket to specify who has access to the resource and what actions they can perform 
	- `Identity/User-based Policies` are attached to an IAM user/group/role to specify what that identity can do
